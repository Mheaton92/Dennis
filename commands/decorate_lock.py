NAME = "decorate lock"
CATEGORIES = ["exits"]
USAGE = "decorate lock <id> <action>"
DESCRIPTION = """Set a custom <action> to display when a player fails to use the locked exit <id> in the current room.

By default, the action text is shown following the player's nickname and one space.
To place the player's name elsewhere in the text, use the %player% marker.
You must own the locked exit or its room in order to decorate it.

Ex. `decorate lock 3 can't seem to get the door open.`
Ex2. `decorate lock 3 The door refuses %player%'s attempt to open it.`"""
